# Module One: Requirements Elicitation
Gathering requirements is an art and a science, and a foundational to systems analysis and design. Proper requirements elicitation is neccessary to establish the scope, funtional requirements, dependencies, contstraints, and business needs being met by the system being analyzed or developed. This is absolutely essential within the context of a waterfall development framework, but also an important aspect within an agile framework where understanding the scope, constraints, and business needs up front are necessary to begin the project - even if requirements may evolve during the agile process.
