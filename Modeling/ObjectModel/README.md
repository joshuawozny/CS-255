# Object Models
Object modeling involves representing, graphically, the objects that exist within a system describing their attributes and behaviors and how each object are related and interact (Valacich & George, 2019).

> <i>CS-255 Module Four Assignment</i> walks through an excersise to describe a system represented by an object model. The example presented is a brick-and-mortar store that wishes to add an online storefront to sell their goods. Their desired online storefron has been modeled for us. We are tasked with provding an analysis of the objects that exist in the system and how their methods represent the functionality of the system. We then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both process and object models.
