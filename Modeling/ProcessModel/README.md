# Process Models
Process modeling involves representing, graphically, the functions that record, manipulate, store, and transfer data between a system and its sources and sinks, and between elements within the system. One standard process model is a data flow diagram (DFD) (Valacich & George, 2019)

> <i>CS-255 Module Three Assignment</i> walks through an excersise to describe a system represented by a process model. The example presented is a brick-and-mortar store that wishes to add an online storefront to sell their goods. Their current process has been modeled for us. We are tasked with provding an analysis of additional processes, sources, sinks, and data stores that are needed to provide for an online store front.
