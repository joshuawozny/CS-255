# Modeling
Business modeling is used to visualize objects and processes within a system. Different types of models exist to aid system systems analysts during the design phase of a project
Common models include:
* Process Model
* Object Model
* Business Use Case 
  * User Stories are often created to view from the User/Customer perspective


## UML Diagrams
Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams are a standard manner in which Models are displayed.
Each model type uses its own subset of UML symbols to most effectively communicate the information relevant to its purpose.
