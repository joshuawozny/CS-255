# CS-255: Systems Analysis and Design
The course introduces the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development, focusing on how to create various system models using appropriate tools, and how to present and articulate technical concepts to nontechnical audiences.

The final project can be found in the [DriverPassSystem directory.](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-255/tree/main/DriverPassSystem)
The project is organized by discrete stages of the Project Life Cycle
* Discovering and documenting system requirement is one of the fundamental purposes of the analysis phase of any project
* Process Modeling bridges the gap between analysis and design by providing a visual representation of system processes
* Design pulls all of information gathered during analysis into documents ready for presentation to various stakeholders.
    * System Design Document (technical): A detailed system design with Process and/or Object Models, Use Cases, and implementation specifications, including funtional and non-functional requirements, user acceptance criteria, hardware and software recomendations, and other details that the development team will need to create the product once the plan is approved.
    * Client Facing Design Document: Often a series of documents as a presentation to inform a non-technical audience of the features and limitations of the system that has been designed. It should include all of the information needed for the client to move forward with the project including timeframes and relatedly, budget.
