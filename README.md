# CS-255: Systems Analysis and Design
The course introduces the principles, methods, and techniques of systems development, focusing on how to create various system models using appropriate tools, and how to present and articulate technical concepts to nontechnical audiences.

The final project can be found [here](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/VectorSorting)
The project is organized by Discrete stages of the Project Life Cycle
* Discovering and documenting system requirement is one of the fundamental purposes of the analysis phase of any project
* Process Modeling bridges the gap between analysis and design by providing a visual representation of system processes
