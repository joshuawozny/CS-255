# CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design
## Driver Pass System
This project completes a system design document based on the requirements you collected and memorialized in the CS 255 Business Requirements 
document by creating proper UML diagrams and describing the systemâ€™s technical requirements in a System Design document and a client facing presentation.
Each document's contents differ based on their intended audience; one a technical audience that requires detailed specifications to develop the system, 
and the other a non-technical audience that needs to understand thefeatures, limitations, scope (particularly timeframes and relatedly, cost).
