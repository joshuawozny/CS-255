# CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design, Final Project
This project completes a system design document based on the requirements you collected and memorialized in the CS 255 Business Requirements 
document by creating proper UML diagrams and describing the systemâ€™s technical requirements in a System Design document and a client facing presentation.
Each document's contents differ based on their intended audience; one a technical audience that requires detailed specifications to develop the system, 
and the other a non-technical audience that needs to understand thefeatures, limitations, scope (particularly timeframes and relatedly, cost).

## Driver Pass System
We have been contracted by DriverPass to bring to market a web-based system to train students for the driving test at their local department of motor vehicles (DMV). It should be able to provide online classes and practice tests to enrolled students. It should also facilitate the scheduling of on-the-road driving instruction.
DriverPass wishes to fill a void in the market, providing online - and in-person - instruction to students preparing for their driver's test with the DMV with the following components:
* Provide tools to students to enroll and take online classes and practice tests
* Provide tools to students and staff to schedule on-the-road instruction.
* Provide administrative tools and reports to DriverPass management.

I was provided a transcript of an interview conducted by our product leader and the previous analyst on the project that has been reassigned. From this transcript 
developed functional and non-functional requirements, and user acceptance criteria. I then analyzed constraints, risks, and assumptions that our system design would be accounting for. Finally I developed process and object models, along with use cases to better understand the flow and dependencies within the system before taking the final design decisions. As a last step, I prepared a presentation to outline the choices I made, the features, limitations, and scope of the project.

Overall our project plan, including requirements documentation and models adequately describe how our system should behave. Taking an iterative approach, these documents were updated as weaknesses were identified that made further work difficult. To make sure our users needs are always at the forefront of decions being made, user stories were developed from use cases whenever possible and used to clarify user acceptance criteria. I kept the client informed of progress, and provided samples, when possible, of the work I was doing - and gave as much flexibility, when possible, to add or refine requirements I had previously identified. 

Client presentation materials not as visually engaging as I would like. Creating visually pleasing presentation is something I need to work on - however, the information presented was clear,and targeted to a non-technical user and was therefore serviceable.

## DESIGN TECHNIQUES
The most important aspect of designing a system is identify requirements. Depending on the methodology, waterfall or agile, this may be done during the intitial phases or continuously throughout the process. Once identified, modeling can assist in orgaizing how the system will work. In particular, I like to create object models, and process flow diagrams. For particular use cases, activity and sequence diagrams may be useful to clarify the system needs. Breaking use cases down into User Stories that present use cases from the user perspective, especially in Agile.
